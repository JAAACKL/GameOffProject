This year’s Game Off theme is  **cliché!**

**Cli-ché**

_noun_

a phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought.

If you've heard a phrase a million times, chances are it's a cliché. For example, “_a blast from the past_,” “_play your cards right_,” “_it’s an uphill battle_,” “_avoid it like the plague_,” and “don’t deploy on a Friday." You catch my drift?

Take one (or more) of your favorite clichés and use them to inspire your game.
