// (桌上的餐点) 
-(food)
The dishes seem expensive and delicious, but gave me a weird feeling … 

Especially the meat, not like beef or pork, and I can see the vein from the bloody meat. 

It is not even medium rare…what is that disgust smelling? 

I didn’t take them, just had some bread and something to drink. 

Anyway, I won’t have any appetite either in this situation.
