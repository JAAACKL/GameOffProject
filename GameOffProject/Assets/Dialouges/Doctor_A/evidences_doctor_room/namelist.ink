"Proud sponsors and Investors of Maston Clinics." 

...

Wait... did I just see my boss's name here?

Hmm. It is him. With a decent amount of money.

Why is he investing in such a clinic for? Considering the business he runs is selling medical supplies?

Is it that the Doctor is getting kickback from him?

Or, is he really invcesting in the "other" business here?
