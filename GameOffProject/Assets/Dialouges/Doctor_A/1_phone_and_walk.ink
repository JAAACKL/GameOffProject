I better call the clinic to let them know I am to go. #speaker:None

"Can you quickly check if the doctor is still in? " #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

[Clinic speaking] "He is. Are you coming to see him?" #speaker:Nurse #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

"I'll arrive in ten minutes." #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

[Clinic speaking] "No problem. We're located on Kirby Avenue, just in case you don't know already." #speaker:F #portrait:neutural #tachie:none
